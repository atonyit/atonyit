### Hi there 👋


<h1 align="center"> About Me 🌏 </h1>
<p>
😎 My name is Alan Tony-Itoyah ~ I was born and raised in the DFW. I enjoy reading and working out in my free time.

📚 I'm a sophomore undergraduate majoring in computer science  at the University of Houston!

🌱 I’m currently learning to build responsive fullstack applications with fully hosted databases.

🌿 I've acquired a keen interest in frontend design. So, I'm learning a multitude of frameworks at the moment.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me at alanitoyah96@gmail.com
